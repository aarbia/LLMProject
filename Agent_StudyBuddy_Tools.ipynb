            "Paste your class notes or text to summarizing: Thoughts represent the Agent’s internal reasoning and planning processes to solve the task.  This utilises the agent’s Large Language Model (LLM) capacity to analyze information when presented in its prompt.  Think of it as the agent’s internal dialogue, where it considers the task at hand and strategizes its approach.  The Agent’s thoughts are responsible for accessing current observations and decide what the next action(s) should be.  Through this process, the agent can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps, reflect on past experiences, and continuously adjust its plans based on new information.  Here are some examples of common thoughts:  Type of Thought\tExample Planning\t“I need to break this task into three steps: 1) gather data, 2) analyze trends, 3) generate report” Analysis\t“Based on the error message, the issue appears to be with the database connection parameters” Decision Making\t“Given the user’s budget constraints, I should recommend the mid-tier option” Problem Solving\t“To optimize this code, I should first profile it to identify bottlenecks” Memory Integration\t“The user mentioned their preference for Python earlier, so I’ll provide examples in Python” Self-Reflection\t“My last approach didn’t work well, I should try a different strategy” Goal Setting\t“To complete this task, I need to first establish the acceptance criteria” Prioritization\t“The security vulnerability should be addressed before adding new features” Note: In the case of LLMs fine-tuned for function-calling, the thought process is optional. In case you’re not familiar with function-calling, there will be more details in the Actions section.  The ReAct Approach A key method is the ReAct approach, which is the concatenation of “Reasoning” (Think) with “Acting” (Act).  ReAct is a simple prompting technique that appends “Let’s think step by step” before letting the LLM decode the next tokens.  Indeed, prompting the model to think “step by step” encourages the decoding process toward next tokens that generate a plan, rather than a final solution, since the model is encouraged to decompose the problem into sub-tasks.  This allows the model to consider sub-steps in more detail, which in general leads to less errors than trying to generate the final solution directly.  ReAct The (d) is an example of ReAct approach where we prompt \"Let's think step by step\" We have recently seen a lot of interest for reasoning strategies. This is what's behind models like Deepseek R1 or OpenAI's o1, which have been fine-tuned to \"think before answering\". These models have been trained to always include specific thinking sections (enclosed between <think> and </think> special tokens). This is not just a prompting technique like ReAct, but a training method where the model learns to generate these sections after analyzing thousands of examples that show what we expect it to do.\n",

            "Paste your class notes or text to turn into flashcards: Actions are the concrete steps an AI agent takes to interact with its environment.  Whether it’s browsing the web for information or controlling a physical device, each action is a deliberate operation executed by the agent.  For example, an agent assisting with customer service might retrieve customer data, offer support articles, or transfer issues to a human representative.  Types of Agent Actions There are multiple types of Agents that take actions differently:  Type of Agent\tDescription JSON Agent\tThe Action to take is specified in JSON format. Code Agent\tThe Agent writes a code block that is interpreted externally. Function-calling Agent\tIt is a subcategory of the JSON Agent which has been fine-tuned to generate a new message for each action. Actions themselves can serve many purposes:  Type of Action\tDescription Information Gathering\tPerforming web searches, querying databases, or retrieving documents. Tool Usage\tMaking API calls, running calculations, and executing code. Environment Interaction\tManipulating digital interfaces or controlling physical devices. Communication\tEngaging with users via chat or collaborating with other agents. The LLM only handles text and uses it to describe the action it wants to take and the parameters to supply to the tool. For an agent to work properly, the LLM must STOP generating new tokens after emitting all the tokens to define a complete Action. This passes control from the LLM back to the agent and ensures the result is parseable - whether the intended format is JSON, code, or function-calling.  The Stop and Parse Approach One key method for implementing actions is the stop and parse approach. This method ensures that the agent’s output is structured and predictable:  Generation in a Structured Format: The agent outputs its intended action in a clear, predetermined format (JSON or code).  Halting Further Generation: Once the text defining the action has been emitted, the LLM stops generating additional tokens. This prevents extra or erroneous output.  Parsing the Output: An external parser reads the formatted action, determines which Tool to call, and extracts the required parameters.  For example, an agent needing to check the weather might output:  Copied Thought: I need to check the current weather for New York. Action : {   \"action\": \"get_weather\",   \"action_input\": {\"location\": \"New York\"} } The framework can then easily parse the name of the function to call and the arguments to apply.  This clear, machine-readable format minimizes errors and enables external tools to accurately process the agent’s command.  Note: Function-calling agents operate similarly by structuring each action so that a designated function is invoked with the correct arguments. We’ll dive deeper into those types of Agents in a future Unit.  Code Agents An alternative approach is using Code Agents. The idea is: instead of outputting a simple JSON object, a Code Agent generates an executable code block—typically in a high-level language like Python.  Code Agents This approach offers several advantages:  Expressiveness: Code can naturally represent complex logic, including loops, conditionals, and nested functions, providing greater flexibility than JSON. Modularity and Reusability: Generated code can include functions and modules that are reusable across different actions or tasks. Enhanced Debuggability: With a well-defined programming syntax, code errors are often easier to detect and correct. Direct Integration: Code Agents can integrate directly with external libraries and APIs, enabling more complex operations such as data processing or real-time decision making. For example, a Code Agent tasked with fetching the weather might generate the following Python snippet:  Copied # Code Agent Example: Retrieve Weather Information def get_weather(city):     import requests     api_url = f\"https://api.weather.com/v1/location/{city}?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY\"     response = requests.get(api_url)     if response.status_code == 200:         data = response.json()         return data.get(\"weather\", \"No weather information available\")     else:         return \"Error: Unable to fetch weather data.\"  # Execute the function and prepare the final answer result = get_weather(\"New York\") final_answer = f\"The current weather in New York is: {result}\" print(final_answer) In this example, the Code Agent:  Retrieves weather data via an API call, Processes the response, And uses the print() function to output a final answer. This method also follows the stop and parse approach by clearly delimiting the code block and signaling when execution is complete (here, by printing the final_answer).  We learned that Actions bridge an agent’s internal reasoning and its real-world interactions by executing clear, structured tasks—whether through JSON, code, or function calls.  This deliberate execution ensures that each action is precise and ready for external processing via the stop and parse approach. In the next section, we will explore Observations to see how agents capture and integrate feedback from their environment.\n",
